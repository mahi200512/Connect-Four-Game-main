Connect Four is a classic two-player game played on a 6x7 grid, where players take turns dropping colored discs (typically red and yellow) into the grid. Here are the basic rules for playing Connect Four:

Setup:
The game begins with an empty 6x7 grid vertically positioned.
Players decide who starts first, typically by coin toss or other random method.
One player takes the red discs, and the other takes the yellow discs.
Gameplay:
Players take turns dropping one of their colored discs into any column of the grid from the top.
The disc falls to the lowest available empty slot in the chosen column.
The goal is to be the first to connect four of one's own discs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Winning Condition:
If a player successfully connects four of their own discs in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), they win the game.
The game ends immediately once a winning condition is met.
Draw Condition:
If the entire grid is filled with discs and no player has connected four discs in a row, the game is a draw.
Variations:
Grid Size: The game can be played on larger or smaller grids, although the standard size is 6x7.
Winning Requirement: Players can adjust the number of discs required to win (e.g., Connect Five) for a longer or shorter game.
Starting Player: Some variations allow the starting player to alternate between games.
Connect Four is a strategic game that requires players to anticipate their opponent's moves while planning their own to achieve victory. It combines elements of strategy, observation, and pattern recognition, making it a popular choice for players of all ages.
